PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is known as a general-purpose scripting language that can be used to develop dynamic and interactive websites. It was among the first server-side languages that could be embedded into HTML, making it easier to add functionality to web pages without needing to call external files for data. Its use has evolved over the years, with regular upgrades ([version 8.0](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php)  was released in November 2020) adding features and unlocking new capabilities.

```php
<?php
echo "I am a PHP script";
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
</html>
```

Though these days it is not considered the sexiest of languages, here are some key PHP benefits that help explain why it is still so important in web development.

- **It’s easy to learn and use:** One of the main reasons PHP became so commonplace is that it is relatively simple to get started with. Even without extensive knowledge or experience in web development, most people could create a web page with a single PHP file in a relatively short period of time. The syntax is simple and command functions are easy to learn, meaning the barriers to entry with PHP are lower than with many other languages.  
  
- **It’s open source (and therefore free!):** This also helps developers get started with PHP - it can be installed quickly and at zero cost. There is also open access to a wide range of PHP frameworks, such as  [Laravel](https://www.jobsity.com/blog/7-reasons-php-developers-love-using-laravel)  and Symfony. This feature is also appealing to companies as it helps control the costs of web development.

- **It’s versatile:** One of the major benefits of PHP is that it is platform independent, meaning it can be used on Mac OS, Windows, Linux and supports most web browsers. It also supports all the major web servers, making it easy to deploy on different systems and platforms at minimal additional cost.  

- **It enjoys strong community support:** As a veteran scripting language that is widely used, PHP now has a large and loyal community base to support it. There are tons of tutorials, FAQs, and tips to help new PHP developers and to continue pushing the boundaries of what the language can achieve through regular updates.  

- **It’s fast and secure:** Two things that every organization wants their website or application to be are fast and secure. PHP uses its own memory and competes well on speed, especially when using the  [newer versions](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/). There have been questions in the past about PHP security, though it is important to note that it is not inherently more or less secure than other programming languages. One important benefit is that because of its widespread use and community support there are now many tools, frameworks and best practices to help fix vulnerabilities and protect against cyberattacks.  

- **It is well connected with databases:** PHP makes it easy to connect securely with almost any kind of database. This gives developers more freedom when choosing which database is best suited for the application being built.  

- **It is tried and tested:** One major benefit of being around for a quarter century is that PHP code has been put to the test in all kinds of real-life environments. The main bugs have been found and fixed, making the language more stable and trusted by developers. Moreover, many frameworks and tools have been built over time, helping to make PHP web development more secure, efficient and effective.  

- **There’s a lot of legacy code:** OK, this isn’t really a benefit of using PHP in itself, but when so many existing websites have been written with PHP it becomes an important consideration. Put simply, it is usually easier to make updates in the same language rather than try to rewrite everything in another. This helps PHP endure even when some younger developers may have a personal preference for another language. This legacy effect also means it is usually easier to find a PHP developer for your organization, though as we have written before on this blog you want to  [make sure they have the right skills](https://www.jobsity.com/blog/php-developer-skills).
