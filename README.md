## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Why do you have so few repositories?**
  I once had a GitHub account with over 40 repositories, but I decided to streamline it for personal and professional reasons. If you'd like to explore my less professional projects, feel free to check out my GitLab [here](https://gitlab.com/joshytheprogrammer).

### We're Using GitHub Under Protest

This project is currently hosted on GitHub. We'd like to express our concerns regarding the use of a proprietary platform like GitHub for open-source projects. We urge you to explore the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand the reasons behind our reservations.
