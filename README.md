# About Me

My Name is **Nsofor Chigoziri Joshua**. I am a **full-stack developer**. My preferred technologies are **Nuxtjs** and **Laravel** but I am also familiar with **Nodejs**. I have worked with several clients over the years and they all had different needs. Some of my clients simply wanted to build blazingly fast static websites, others preferred a more grounded approach - robust full-stack websites that can adapt to the needs of their businesses. I am also familiar with the micro-service architecture. No matter what kind of website you need, you can trust that I can build it cost efficiently. After all, I am **joshytheprogrammer**.

 1. **Why do you have so few repositories?**

> I actually had a GitHub account with over 40 repositories, but I deleted that for personal reason. I would also like to keep this GitHub professional. If you would like to see my less professional projects, see my GitLab [here](https://gitlab.com/joshy111).
